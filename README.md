# Complex Number
Structure use of complex number with some basic math functions

	complexNumber = real + 1j*imag

1. In C
	Structure is used to implement complex number.
	Input & output data type is "float", which can be changed (using typedef) according to need.
	Basic complex functions are implemented.
	Example is shown in "example.c".
	"makefile" is to used to build the files (type "make" to build).
	Output executable is "niam"

2. In CPP
	Class is used to implement complex number.
	Input & output data type is "float", which can be changed (using typedef) according to need.
	Real and imag variable are private in this class.
	Basic complex functions are implemented.
	Example is shown in "example.cpp".
	"makefile" is to build automatically (type "make" to build).
	Output executable is "niam".
