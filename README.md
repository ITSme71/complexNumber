# complexNumber
structure use of complex number with some basic math functions
    complex number = real + 1j*imag

1. In C
    structure is used to implement comlex number
    input & output data type is "float", which can be changed (using typedef) according to need
    basic complex functions are implemented
    example is shown in "example.c"
    "makefile" is to build automatically (type "make" to build)
    output executable is "niam"

2. In CPP
    class is used to implement comlex number
    input & output data type is "float", which can be changed (using typedef) according to need
    real and imag variable are private in this class
    basic complex functions are implemented
    example is shown in "example.cpp"
    "makefile" is to build automatically (type "make" to build)
    output executable is "niam"
